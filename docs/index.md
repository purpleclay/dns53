# dns53

Dynamic DNS within Amazon Route 53. Expose your EC2 quickly, easily, and privately within a Route 53 Private Hosted Zone (PHZ).

Easily collaborate with a colleague by exposing your EC2 within a team VPC. You could even hook up a locally running application to a local k3d cluster using an ExternalName service during development. Once your EC2 is exposed, control how it is accessed through your EC2 security groups.

Written in Go, `dns53` is incredibly small and easy to install.
